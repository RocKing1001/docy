# Getting Started

New to TCore? TCore is a simple concept at its core and this library will make it even simpler to work with

Tcore is a set of utilities and APIs allowing a developer to easily interact with the users device through sAPI requests. This allows for websites, web apps, native apps and even other machines to communicate with the device without the need of having the users manual interaction. Things such as: 

- Login-in become as simple as selecting the account from a list of given options 
- Checking a crypto wallet balance by a website now only requires the user to give a single permission
- Websites can save data securely on the device instead of caching it in the web browser

All of this can be easily implemented through combined efforts of TcoreLib.JS and cogs for the Tcore. The following library allows for simpliefied interactions with the SAPI and Asgard APIs.

## How does this work

Internally, this library works with an api, which is hosted on any smartphone running the TCore Bundle. This bundle is preinstalled with TecTone OS. The library manages authorisation and authentication, the tokens and renewals, etc leaving a good DX for the programmer, and a bug free experience for the end user


## Example 

```js [index.ts]
import { connect } from 'tcore';

const tc = await connect();

console.log(tc.info());
```
