# Installation

Installation for TCore SDK can be done finished with a few commands!!

The installation is split into two parts:
1. TCore Bundle
2. TCore library

## TCore Bundle

This is the backend for TCore, where the sAPI and Asgard API is hosted. This will be installed as a docker container along side some automation scripts. You need Docker and Python (>=3.9) installed on your system.

To begin the installation, run the following in bash shell. [This](https://tcore.dev) script is run on your system to install the required components.

::shellblock
#code
```bash
$ curl "install.tcore.dev/bundle" | bash
```
::

Follow the steps on screen to complete the installation. A binary for managing this bundle will also be installed on your system in `/home/.local/bin`. Make sure that the directory is added to `PATH`.


## TCore Lib

The TCore bundle which was just installed could be used as is. Communications happen between the client and the server through several APIs. To simplify the process of Client - Server communication, a TCore lib is recommended. This is the official JS/TS lib for TCore, and can be installed by adding the `tcore` package to your `package.json`
